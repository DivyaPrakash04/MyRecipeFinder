# MyRecipeFinder - Vercel Deployment Options

## Why Vercel?

Vercel is excellent for React applications and offers:
- **Better performance** with edge caching
- **Superior developer experience** with great CLI and dashboard
- **Excellent analytics** and monitoring
- **Generous free tier** (100GB bandwidth/month)

## Deployment Options with Vercel

### Option 1: Vercel Frontend + Railway Backend (Recommended)

**Railway** is similar to Render but often faster for Python apps:
- **Free tier**: $5/month credit (more than Render)
- **No sleep**: Apps stay awake longer
- **Python-optimized**: Better support for Flask

**Steps:**
1. Deploy frontend to Vercel (GitHub ‚Üí Vercel)
2. Deploy backend to Railway (GitHub ‚Üí Railway)
3. Update `vercel.json` with your Railway backend URL

### Option 2: Vercel Frontend + Render Backend

**Render** is reliable and straightforward:
- **Free tier**: 512MB RAM, sleeps after inactivity
- **Proven track record** with Flask apps
- **Good logging** and monitoring

**Steps:**
1. Deploy frontend to Vercel
2. Deploy backend to Render
3. Update `render.yaml` and `vercel.json` URLs

### Option 3: Vercel Frontend + Fly.io Backend

**Fly.io** offers global deployment:
- **Free tier**: 3GB RAM-months + 160GB bandwidth
- **Global regions**: Deploy closer to users
- **Docker-based**: More flexible

## Quick Setup with Railway

### 1. Deploy Frontend to Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from project root
vercel

# Follow prompts to connect GitHub and deploy
```

### 2. Deploy Backend to Railway
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login and connect project
railway login
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 3. Update Configuration
- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel dashboard
- Add API keys as environment variables in Railway
- Update `vercel.json` with your Railway backend URL

## Environment Variables

### Vercel (Frontend)
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
```

### Railway/Render (Backend)
```
FLASK_ENV=production
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

## Performance Comparison

## Recommendation

**Go with Vercel + Railway** for the best experience:

1. **Better Performance**: Railway often has faster cold starts
2. **No Sleep Issues**: Railway apps wake up faster
3. **Great Developer Experience**: Both have excellent dashboards
4. **Global CDN**: Vercel provides edge caching worldwide

## Cost Comparison

- **Vercel**: $0 (100GB/month free)
- **Railway**: $0 (up to $5/month free credit)
- **Total**: $0/month

Railway's $5 free credit goes further than Render's free tier for Python apps.

## Vercel CLI Commands

```bash
# Deploy production
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables
vercel env add VITE_API_BASE_URL

# View logs
vercel logs

# Rollback
vercel rollback
```

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your backend**: Railway (recommended) or Render
2. **Deploy frontend**: `vercel --prod`
3. **Deploy backend**: Use Railway CLI or GitHub integration
4. **Test thoroughly**: Check all API endpoints work
5. **Monitor**: Use both dashboards to track usage

Vercel + Railway gives you the best of both worlds: Vercel's excellent frontend hosting and Railway's robust Python backend support! üöÄ
